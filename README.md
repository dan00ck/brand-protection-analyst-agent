# AI Brand Protection Analyst Agent

A semantic brand protection agent powered by Google's Open Source Gemini 2.5 Pro AI Model. This tool helps detect fraudulent, malicious, or brand-abusing domains across the internet using advanced LLM-based semantic analysis and customizable analyst personas.

---

## Motivation

After years working with threat intelligence and brand protection products, I've reverse-engineered some truly "creative" evaluation techniques.  
One of the most memorable: a major platform that hard-cuts domain feeds, **discarding any domain that doesn't start or end with the brand name**. 

This shortcut is often necessary to reduce the flood of irrelevant fullword matches.
For **short brand names** like **"tui"** or **"otto"**, it comes at a serious cost:
Thousands of potentially threatening domains are silently lost every week.

Domains like `secure-tui-login[.]com`, `my-tui-booking[.]net` or `nl-ottoshop[.]nl` never reach analyst desks because they fail a basic syntax check.

This project was born from the need to: 
- **think semantically, not just syntactically**, 
- **detect threats beyond keyword / dictionary matches**, 
- empower analysts with **LLM-based reasoning**,
- recognize **internationalized and multilingual domain patterns** — domain registrations in localized variations are often missed by static dictionary-based systems.

## Features

- **Semantic Threat Detection** — Detects impersonation, phishing, and domain abuse based on brand context on a large scale.
- **Analyst Modes** — Choose between junior, senior, and expert AI analyst personas.
- **Batch Processing** — Efficiently handles large domain datasets via Gemini API.
- **Structured Output** — Saves results with confidence scores, risk levels, and explanations.
- **Flexible API Key Handling** — Use command-line, environment variables, `.env`, or secure prompt.
- **Example Analysis Results:**

## Domain File and Output Files

### Input Domain Files

1. Place domain files in `data/` folder
2. Use `.txt` format with one domain per line
3. Example:
   ```
   data/
   ├── tui.txt
   ├── otto.txt
   └── gea.txt
   ```

### Output Files

All output files are stored in the `data/` folder and include:

- `*_threats.csv` — Identified threat domains
- `*_filtered.csv` — Domains considered safe
- `*_complete.json` — Full analysis report

Each `.csv` contains:

- Domain
- Confidence score
- Relevance
- Risk level
- Explanation
